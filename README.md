### VEHICLE-DETECTOR-AT-SHARP-BENDS   ⛔


----------The proposed project idea is to prevent accident on sharp road bends specially in mountainous roads.
          The brief content of the project is basically it helps
the car driver to detect whether there is any car near its coverage which can cause accident.
          If there is any car in opposite direction towards its turning the senser will detect it and show signals to the other car thus the driver may prevent the accident. 

It is very important to increase research and development in the field of computer application for preventing road accident.

The detection of vehicle around sharp ends is a critical factor for preventing accidents.

This project is to ensure safe driving conditions.

It uses two ultrasonic sensor placed at the sharp bends at an angle of 90° with a set of set of LED indicating and informing the status of vehicles on the other side of the roads. These lights are present at the point of intersection of roads thereby informing both the parties. 
### COLOUR REFERENCE:       🚥

🔴 RED--When the cars are very     
close to each other which can cause accident immediately

🟡 YELLOW--when the cars are at medium distance such as there is a lesser chance of accident

🔵 BLUE--when the distance is very high or there is no car in the accident range.
