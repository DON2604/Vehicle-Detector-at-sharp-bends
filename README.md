VEHICLE-DETECTOR-AT-SHARP-BENDS


----------The proposed project idea is to prevent accident on sharp road bends.
          The brief content of the project is basically it helps
the car driver to detect whether there is any car near its coverage which can cause accident 
          If there is any car in opposite direction towards its turning the senser will detect it and show signals to the other car thus the driver may prevent the accident.        ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

It is very important to increase research and development in the field of computer vesion and machine learning for preventing road accident.

The detection of vehicle around sharp ends is a critical factor for preventing accidents.

this project is to ensure safe driving conditions.
